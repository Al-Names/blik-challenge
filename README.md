## To get this running is super easy. 

## First:
- Clone this repository

- Then cd into either the front-end(react-bit) or the back-end(mock-server) and start it up. Then do the same for the other.


## You run the front-end side by running: 

```
yarn or install
```
- then
```
yarn or npm start
```

## Then the back by running the following using python `3.6.3`.

```
pip install pipenv
```
- then
```
pipenv install
```
- then
```
pipenv run python server.py
```

### And you're good to go!
